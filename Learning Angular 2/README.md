## About this book

The most ambitious overview of Angular 2 on the market up to nowâ€”this guide gathers together everything there is to know about Angular 2 and groups it in intuitive sections. No hunting through confusing documentation or scrambling piecemeal to figure out how things work together; this book is your detailed map of every feature and its use cases.

The author has done all the hard work of fitting everything Angular 2 means for developers together for you, making this book the quickest way to learn Angular 2 from scratch. This is an inexpensive, yet invaluable addition to every Angular user's toolkit to refer back to time and again. It's great for newcomers to Angular who will learn best through clear explanations and definitions of concepts.

## Who this book is for

This book is targeted at web developers who want to build the next generation of state-of-the-art mobile and desktop web applications with Angular 2. This book does not require you to have prior exposure to either Angular 1.x or 2, although comprehensive knowledge of Javascript is assumed.

### What do you need to run the examples?

Each chapter folder contains a standalone project which is in fact the incremental iteration of the Pomodoro application that we will build through the learning journey proposed in the book. You will want to follow the deployment guidelines included at the README file available on each chapter folder.

You will want to have a local web server pointing to the example folder you want to check. for the sake of simplicity I recommend using the excellent [lite-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server) package provided by John Papa.

### Disclaimer

While the Angular 2 project keeps moving forward and has not reached a final version, breaking changes in the codebase may affect the reliability of the code examples provided.

The author will do its best to keep the code samples provided as up-to-date as possible, but we understand that you may encounter outdated snippets or missing scripts. Please post your enquiries in the [issues page](https://github.com/deeleman/learning-angular2/issues) should you require further assistance.
